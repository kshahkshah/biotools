/******************** ORIGINAL SKIN ******************/

 * The CSS below is my attempt to extract most of the stuff you need to change in order
 * to reskin the menu with the appearance you require. However, certain rules above
 * (indicated with the word "VARIABLE") may also need to be altered to suit the width
 * and height of your menu items and submenus. For example, if you need wider submenus
 * eg: .nav ul { width:12em} then you will need to also apply that value
 * to the left offset of any deeper nested submenus, eg:
 * .nav li li:hover ul,
 * ul.nav li li.sfHover ul {
	 left:12em; top:-1px;
   }
 *
 * Other than that, most of the cosmetic stuff is below:
