== Welcome to BioTools ==

Molecular Biology Tools for Humans

If you're interested in joining the project email Kunal Shah, kunal ashok shah (at) gmail dot com

I've just set up this project, and rather than porting old functionality from my php based biotools website, 
I'm recreating this site in Rails. The front end interface will be the first thing to developed. I intend to 
make it a "skin" of sorts for the BioRuby library.

I'm exploring ways to save, pipe, share, import and export the various data types on the site. If you have a 
suggestion I'd love to hear it. As developers join the project I'll move to a more disciplined feature based 
release schedule and start forking off development. Until then:

=====
This project is in a pre-alpha state and clearly not meant to be used yet. When that changes this message will too.
